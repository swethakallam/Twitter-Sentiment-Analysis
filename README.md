# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis

I used packages like Tweepy and textblob to get tweets and found their polarity and subjectivity. 

As I couldn't use tweepy to get tweets older than a week. I cloned a package(https://github.com/marquisvictor/Optimized-Modified-GetOldTweets3-OMGOT) from github and could get older tweets.
